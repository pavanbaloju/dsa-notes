## **1. What is the Two Pointers Technique?**

The **Two Pointers technique** is used to optimize problems that involve **traversing an array, list, or string** from two different directions. Instead of using nested loops (**O(n²)**), we use two pointers to achieve **O(n)** time complexity.

## **2. Variations of Two Pointers Technique**

|**Variation**|**When to Use?**|**Common Problems**|**Time Complexity**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**1. Opposite Direction (Two Ends)**|Searching for **pairs**, sorting-related problems|✅ Two Sum (Sorted)  <br>✅ Valid Palindrome  <br>✅ Container With Most Water|**O(n)**|
|**2. Same Direction (Sliding Window)**|Finding **subarrays/substrings** with conditions|✅ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters  <br>✅ Smallest Subarray with Sum ≥ K|**O(n)**|
|**3. Merge Two Sorted Arrays**|Merging sorted sequences|✅ Merge Sorted Arrays  <br>✅ Intersection of Two Sorted Arrays|**O(n)**|
|**4. Partitioning**|Separating elements based on conditions|✅ Dutch National Flag (Sort Colors)  <br>✅ Move Zeros to End|**O(n)**|
