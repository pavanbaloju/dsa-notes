## 🌳 TRIES PATTERNS – INTERVIEW REVISION GUIDE

### 🔹 What is a Trie?

A **Trie** (pronounced “try”) is a prefix tree used for efficient retrieval of keys in a dataset of strings.

- Each node stores **characters**, not entire words.
    
- Fast prefix search: `O(L)` where `L` is length of the word.
    
- Space-intensive, but highly optimized for dictionary-like data.

## 🧱 BASIC TRIE OPERATIONS

|Operation|Description|Time Complexity|
|---|---|---|
|`insert(word)`|Add a word to the Trie|O(L)|
|`search(word)`|Check if a word exists|O(L)|
|`startsWith(prefix)`|Check if any word starts with the prefix|O(L)|

📌 **Node Structure**:

```java
class TrieNode {
    TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26]; // assuming lowercase English letters
    boolean isEndOfWord = false;
}
```

📌 **Trie Structure**:

```java
class Trie {
    private TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
    
    void insert(String word) { ... }
    boolean search(String word) { ... }
    boolean startsWith(String prefix) { ... }
}
```

## 🔍 PATTERN 1: Prefix Matching

Use when:

- You need to check if words start with a certain prefix
    
- You need autocomplete / dictionary behavior
    

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree)
    
- [Longest Word in Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-word-in-dictionary)
    
- [Replace Words](https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words)
    

---

## 🔁 PATTERN 2: Word Search in Grids

Use Trie to optimize word search in a grid:

- Build Trie from the dictionary
    
- Use DFS + Trie for efficient backtracking
    

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii)
    
- [Boggle Board Solver] (common system design/trie combo)
    

---

## 🧮 PATTERN 3: Count Words / Prefix Frequency

Use Trie to:

- Count how many words share a given prefix
    
- Count how many times a word was inserted
    

🧠 **Enhancement:** Add a `prefixCount` and `wordCount` in each node.

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Map Sum Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/map-sum-pairs)
    
- [Design Add and Search Words Data Structure](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure)
    

---

## 💡 PATTERN 4: Search with Wildcards

Use Trie to support `'.'` as wildcard:

- Use DFS on Trie for each wildcard
    

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Add and Search Word - Data Structure Design](https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure)
    

---

## 🧮 PATTERN 5: Bitwise Trie / Binary Trie

Use when:

- You need to store numbers as bits instead of characters
    
- Often used for **XOR-related problems**
    

📌 Each Trie node has:

```java
TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[2]; // 0 and 1
```

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Maximum XOR of Two Numbers in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-of-two-numbers-in-an-array)
    
- [Find Maximum XOR With an Element From Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-xor-with-an-element-from-array)
    

---

## 💰 PATTERN 6: Lexicographical Order

Use Trie when you want to sort strings lexicographically during search or DFS.

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Lexicographical Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/lexicographical-numbers)
    

---

## 🔒 PATTERN 7: Palindromic Words + Tries

Insert reversed strings into Trie and check for palindromic prefix/suffix.

🧠 **Problems:**

- [Palindrome Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-pairs)
    

---

## 🔧 ADVANCED ENHANCEMENTS

|Feature|Use Case|
|---|---|
|`wordCount`|Count frequency of word insertions|
|`prefixCount`|Count how many words have a prefix|
|Suffix Trie|For substring matching|
|Compressed Trie|Space optimization (Radix Tree)|
|Ternary Search Trie|Like BST but for strings (less common)|

---

## 🧠 TRIE-BASED SYSTEM DESIGN USE CASES

- **Autocomplete Systems**
    
- **Search Engine Dictionary**
    
- **Spell Checker**
    
- **Word Suggestions**
    
- **IP Routing (with Bit Tries)**
