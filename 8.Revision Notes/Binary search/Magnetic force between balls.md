Here are the **full notes** on **Magnetic Force Between Balls** with a well-explained **binary search approach** and a **Java implementation with comments**.

## **üìå Problem Understanding**

We are given an array `position[]`, where `position[i]` represents a valid placement location for a ball. We also have an integer `m`, which represents the number of balls we need to place.

Our goal is to **maximize the minimum magnetic force** between any two balls.

### **üîπ Key Observations**

- The **minimum force** possible is `1`, and the **maximum force** is `max(position) - min(position)`.
    
- The force between two balls is simply the absolute difference between their positions.
    
- **Greedy + Binary Search Approach** works because if a force `d` is valid, any force `< d` is also valid.

## **üìå Approach: Binary Search on Answer**

### **üîπ Step 1: Sort the Positions**

Since balls must be placed in an increasing order, sorting `position[]` ensures we can greedily place balls at the farthest available locations.

### **üîπ Step 2: Apply Binary Search on Force**

- **Search space:** The possible minimum force can be from **1 to (max - min)**.
    
- **Mid-point represents a candidate force**: We check if we can place `m` balls with at least this force.
    
- **Feasibility Check (`canPlaceBalls`)**
    
    - Start placing the first ball at the first position.
        
    - For each subsequent ball, place it at the **first available position** that is at least `mid` units away from the last placed ball.
        
    - If we can place `m` balls, the force is feasible, and we try for a **larger force** (`low = mid + 1`).
        
    - Otherwise, we **reduce the force** (`high = mid - 1`).

## **üìå Java Code with Comments**

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] position, int m) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array to place balls in increasing order
        Arrays.sort(position);

        // Step 2: Define search space (minimum possible force = 1, max = max-min)
        int low = 1, high = position[position.length - 1] - position[0];
        int result = 0;

        // Step 3: Binary search to find the maximum minimum force
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2; // Candidate force

            if (canPlaceBalls(position, m, mid)) {
                result = mid; // Store the valid force
                low = mid + 1; // Try a larger force
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Reduce the force
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    // Helper function to check if we can place 'm' balls with at least 'minForce' distance apart
    private boolean canPlaceBalls(int[] position, int m, int minForce) {
        int count = 1; // First ball is placed at the first position
        int lastPlaced = position[0]; // Position of the last placed ball

        // Iterate through positions and place the next ball if possible
        for (int i = 1; i < position.length; i++) {
            if (position[i] - lastPlaced >= minForce) {
                count++; // Place a ball
                lastPlaced = position[i]; // Update the last placed ball position
            }
            if (count == m) return true; // Successfully placed all balls
        }
        return false; // Not enough positions for 'm' balls
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] position = {1, 2, 3, 4, 7};
        int m = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.maxDistance(position, m)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## **üìå Dry Run Example**

### **Input:**

```java
position = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7], m = 3
```

### **Sorted Positions:**

```
1, 2, 3, 4, 7
```

### **Binary Search Process:**

|`low`|`high`|`mid`|`canPlaceBalls(mid)`|Action|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|6|3|‚úÖ Yes|`low = 4`|
|4|6|5|‚ùå No|`high = 4`|
|4|4|4|‚úÖ Yes|`low = 5` (Stop)|

### **Final Answer:**

The largest minimum force is **3**.

## **üìå Complexity Analysis**

- **Sorting** takes **O(N log N)**.
    
- **Binary Search** runs for **O(log(max-min))** iterations.
    
- **Checking Feasibility** (`canPlaceBalls`) takes **O(N)** per iteration.
    

‚è≥ **Final Complexity:** **O(N log N + N log M) ‚âà O(N log M)** (where `M = max(position) - min(position)`).

---

## **üìå Why Does Binary Search Work?**

- The problem **asks for an optimal numerical value** (largest minimum force).
    
- The feasibility function (`canPlaceBalls`) **is monotonic**:
    
    - If force `d` is possible, then `‚â§ d` is also possible.
        
    - If force `d` is not possible, then `‚â• d` is also not possible.

## **üìå Summary**

|Step|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**1. Sort the positions**|Ensures correct order for greedy placement.|
|**2. Use Binary Search on the force**|`low = 1, high = max-min`, search for largest `minForce`.|
|**3. Check feasibility (`canPlaceBalls`)**|Try to place `m` balls while maintaining `minForce`.|
|**4. Adjust search range**|If possible, increase `low`; otherwise, decrease `high`.|
|**5. Return the largest feasible force**|This is the final answer.|
