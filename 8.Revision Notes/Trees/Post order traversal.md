# 🌲 Postorder Traversal – Revised & Explained Notes

---

## ✅ What is Postorder Traversal?

**Order of visiting:**

```
Left → Right → Root
```

### Use-cases:

- Safely delete or free nodes (children before parent)
    
- Evaluate expression trees (postfix)
    
- Used in recursive tree processing (e.g., max depth, LCA, etc.)

## 🔁 Approaches Overview

|Approach|Space|Complexity|Suitability|
|---|---|---|---|
|1. Recursive|O(h) call stack|O(n)|Clean, intuitive, less control|
|2. Iterative with 2 stacks|O(n)|O(n)|Easy to understand|
|3. Iterative with 1 stack|O(n) worst|O(n)|Optimized, but trickier to implement|
|4. Morris Traversal|O(1)|O(n)|Advanced, only for interview edge cases|

## 🌿 1. Recursive Postorder Traversal

### ✅ Explanation:

You go as deep as possible **left → right**, and process the node **after** its children.

### ✅ Java Code:

```java
void postorderRecursive(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return;
    postorderRecursive(root.left);
    postorderRecursive(root.right);
    System.out.print(root.val + " ");
}
```

---

## 🌿 2. Iterative Postorder – Using 2 Stacks

### ✅ Explanation:

We simulate postorder using two stacks:

- Stack1 does **preorder reverse** (`Root → Right → Left`)
    
- Stack2 reverses it to get **postorder** (`Left → Right → Root`)
    

### ✅ Java Code:

```java
void postorderTwoStacks(TreeNode root) {
    if (root == null) return;

    Stack<TreeNode> s1 = new Stack<>();
    Stack<TreeNode> s2 = new Stack<>();

    s1.push(root);
    while (!s1.isEmpty()) {
        TreeNode node = s1.pop();
        s2.push(node);
        if (node.left != null) s1.push(node.left);
        if (node.right != null) s1.push(node.right);
    }

    while (!s2.isEmpty()) {
        System.out.print(s2.pop().val + " ");
    }
}
```

## 🌿 3. Iterative Postorder – Using 1 Stack and `lastVisited`

### ✅ Explanation:

This simulates recursion **without extra memory** for a second stack.

We:

- Go left as far as possible.
    
- Peek at the top node.
    
    - If it has a **right child not yet visited**, move right.
        
    - Else, process (pop) the node.
        

### ✅ Java Code:

```java
void postorderOneStack(TreeNode root) {
    Stack<TreeNode> stack = new Stack<>();
    TreeNode current = root, lastVisited = null;

    while (current != null || !stack.isEmpty()) {
        if (current != null) {
            stack.push(current);
            current = current.left;
        } else {
            TreeNode peek = stack.peek();
            if (peek.right != null && lastVisited != peek.right) {
                current = peek.right;
            } else {
                System.out.print(peek.val + " ");
                lastVisited = stack.pop();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## 🧠 Dry Run – One Stack (Key Insight)

If we’ve **visited the right child already**, we can safely pop the root.

If not, we **must visit the right child first.**

Example:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```

We push all left nodes (1 → 2 → 4), process 4, backtrack to 2, then go right to 5, then finally 2 and 1.

## 📈 Time & Space Complexity

|Approach|Time|Space|
|---|---|---|
|Recursive|O(n)|O(h) (stack)|
|Iterative (2 stack)|O(n)|O(n)|
|Iterative (1 stack)|O(n)|O(h) ~ O(n)|
|Morris (Threaded)|O(n)|O(1)|

---

## ⚠️ Edge Cases

|Case|How to Handle|
|---|---|
|`root == null`|Return early|
|Tree with one node|Output single value|
|Left-skewed or right-skewed|Depth becomes O(n)|

---

## 🔗 When to Use Which?

|Use This|If…|
|---|---|
|Recursive|You want simplicity and readability|
|Iterative (2-stack)|Interview or limited recursion stack|
|Iterative (1-stack)|You need optimization, low space|
|Morris|You want constant space (advanced)|
