Absolutely. Here‚Äôs a **generic, repeatable template** for solving **Dynamic Programming (DP)** problems. This applies to both **1D** and **2D** DP, and can be adapted for **top-down (memoization)** and **bottom-up (tabulation)** approaches.

---

## üß± Dynamic Programming Template (Step-by-Step)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Identify if DP applies

Ask:

- **Optimal substructure**: Can the problem be broken into subproblems?
    
- **Overlapping subproblems**: Are subproblems solved multiple times?
    
- **Decision at each step**: Do we make a choice and build from it?
    

If **yes**, it‚Äôs a candidate for DP.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Define the DP State

Clearly define:

- What does `dp[i]` (or `dp[i][j]`) **represent**?
    

For example:

- `dp[i]` = minimum cost to reach index `i`
    
- `dp[i][j]` = true if a string from index `i` to `j` is a palindrome
    

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Define Recurrence Relation (Transition)

Figure out how to build `dp[i]` from previous results:

- Example: `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]`
    
- For 2D: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]`
    

This is where logic and problem constraints are encoded.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Base Cases

What are the smallest subproblems?

- `dp[0] = ...`, `dp[1] = ...`
    
- For 2D: `dp[0][0] = ...`
    

Initialize them accordingly.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Decide Bottom-Up or Top-Down

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

- Create a DP table and fill from base to goal
    
- Often faster due to no recursion overhead
    

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Top-Down (Memoization)

- Use recursion and cache results
    
- Easier to write for tree-like or recursive problems
    

---

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Build DP Table or Call Recursive Function

- Bottom-Up: `for` loops
    
- Top-Down: recursive calls + memo
    

---

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Return Final Answer

This could be:

- `dp[n]`
    
- `dp[n][m]`
    
- `max(dp[i])`
    
- etc.

## üì¶ Java Code Templates

---

### üß† Top-Down (Memoization)

```java
Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

int dfs(int i, int j, ...) {
    String key = i + "," + j; // if multiple params
    if (memo.containsKey(key)) return memo.get(key);

    // Base case
    if (i >= n) return 0;

    // Transition
    int res = Math.max(dfs(i+1, j), dfs(i, j+1));

    memo.put(key, res);
    return res;
}
```

---

### üß† Bottom-Up (Tabulation)

```java
int[] dp = new int[n + 1]; // or int[][] dp = new int[m+1][n+1];

// Base case
dp[0] = ...;

// Build table
for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], ...);
}

return dp[n];
```

---

### üß† Space Optimization

Only store the last 2 or 3 states if recurrence only depends on them.

```java
int prev = 0, curr = 1;
for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
    int next = prev + curr;
    prev = curr;
    curr = next;
}
return curr;
```

## üßÆ Debug Checklist

|Step|Question|
|---|---|
|1.|What is the **state**? `dp[i]` means?|
|2.|What is the **transition formula**?|
|3.|What are the **base cases**?|
|4.|What is the **final result** you return?|
|5.|Can it be **optimized** for space?|
|6.|Are **all subproblems reachable** from your loop or recursion?|
